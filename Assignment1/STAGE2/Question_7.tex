    \end{lstlisting}
\item This will \textbf{instantiate} X with a number, either 10 or 15.
\item However, both will prove false in the second query when field(X, Y) is instantiated and resolved to either field(15, Y) or field(10, Y).

    \begin{lstlisting}
    course(X, Y), lab_number(Y, 15).
    course(X, Z), field(Z, Y).
    \end{lstlisting}
\item Evaluate both goals results in unification as followed:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    course(hit_transfer, mechanical), lab_number(mechanical, 15), field(mechanical, engineering).
